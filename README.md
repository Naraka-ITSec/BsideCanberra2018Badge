Bside Canberra Badge 2018 Modification
By Naraka
Hi everyone,
First of all, I would like to thank everyone for checking out my FIRST ever WriteUp.
I have always since I was young being doing stuff with Arduino Boards. Once I found out that the Badge was an Arduino ESP8266 I got excited. I did a bit of research about this board.

I hope with this write up you are able to replicate what I have done.
